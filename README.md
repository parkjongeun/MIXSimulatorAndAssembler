# An implementation of the MIX simulator and assembler

The MIX is a mythical computer used in the book TAOCP(http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html).

> MIX is very much like nearly every computer now in existence (except that it is, perhaps, nicer).
> The language of MIX has been designed to be powerful enough to allow brief programs to be written for most algorithms, yet simple enough so that its operations are easily learned.
> -- Donald E. Knuth (1968)
